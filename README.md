Overview of the project 

PROJECT : To Do List Web Application 

The To-Do List app is a simple and interactive React.js application designed to help users manage their daily tasks. It provides essential CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, allowing users to add new tasks, mark them as complete, edit, and delete them. The app demonstrates core React concepts such as state management, component-based architecture, and event handling. It also ensures a responsive and user-friendly experience with basic CSS styling.

Objectives 

Task Management:

Enable users to keep track of their tasks by adding, editing, and deleting tasks.
Mark Tasks as Complete:

Users can mark a task as completed to visually distinguish between pending and completed tasks.
Filter Tasks Based on Status (Optional Future Feature):

This app can be expanded to provide filters to view only completed or pending tasks.
Demonstrate React Fundamentals:

Illustrate key React concepts:
Components: App split into logical parts (like tasks and input fields).
State Management: Handle dynamic data using Reactâ€™s useState hook.
Event Handling: Respond to user actions like adding or deleting tasks.
Responsive Design:

With CSS styling, the app is simple, responsive, and easy to use on any device size
